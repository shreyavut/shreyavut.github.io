                     Rampant pollution caused manatees to starve. Florida waters are getting worse.</a></b>

                  </a></b>
                     <p>Over the course of 18 months, I developed a methodology to determine that Florida waters grew increasingly polluted over the last quarter-century, even as the state spent millions of dollars on clean-up efforts. This first-of-its-kind analysis is among the only comprehensive looks at how nutrient pollution has tainted nearly a quarter of Florida waterways.</p></li>

                     <p>I used shell scripting and spatial analysis tools in R to extract sea surface temperature and ocean heatwave data for every point in an Atlantic tropical cyclone path since 1980. The story found that ocean warming due to climate change statistically increased the chances of rapid intensification. We also examined how these powerful storms are uniquely threatening to communnities along the Gulf of Mexico coastline.</p></li>

                    <p>For these stories on major hurricanes, I analyzed building footprints, flood zone data, and surge inundation predictions to determine which properties in Tampa Bay counties and in Florida's Big Bend were most vulnerable to severe flooding. These reports offered some of the earliest and most comprehensive estimates of the storms' devastating impact.</p>

                    <p>Using command-line tools, I extracted Florida Department of Transportation camera footage to create gifs and videos. These visuals showed flooding, storm surge, and heavy traffic during Florida's largest evacuation in recent memory, enhancing our live storm coverage.</p>

                      <p>I analyzed school parcel, crime and demographic data to show how shootings of teenagers in Baltimore were increasing, all within just blocks of schools. Ninety four percent of those shootings were in the â€œBlack Butterfly," an area of the city with a history of disinvestment and segregation.
